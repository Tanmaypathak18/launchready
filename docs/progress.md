# Progress

One "Done so far" entry per phase, newest first: what shipped, decisions made, what's next.

## Phase 0: Setup (2026-11-02)

- **Shipped:** uv-managed Python 3.11 scaffold with a Typer CLI (`fit`, `brief`, `radar` stubs that print "not implemented"), docstring-only modules, ruff + pytest smoke tests, GitHub Actions CI, Apache-2.0 LICENSE, README Status checklist, friction log template.
- **Decisions:** `typer` is the only runtime dependency; huggingface_hub, Jinja2 and PyYAML get added in the phase that needs them. Stub commands exit with code 1 so nobody mistakes them for working.
- **Next:** Phase 1 (memory calculator: `launchready fit`). Repo is public at Tanmaypathak18/launchready with CI green.
